# dotfiles

My current dotfiles setup.  I use [YADR](https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles) as a bootstrap.  This repository contains extra configurations, and is maintained using [RCM](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm).  You may also need to install the [powerline patched fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts).
