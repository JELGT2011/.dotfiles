# dotfiles

My current dotfiles setup.  I use [YADR](https://github.com/skwp/dotfiles) as a bootstrap.  This repository contains extra 
configurations, and is maintained using [RCM](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm).

## Install

Ensure you have rcp and yadr already installed.
Clone the directory and run the `install.sh` script.
